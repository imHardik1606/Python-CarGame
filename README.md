# Car Command Line Game

This is a simple command-line Python program that simulates controlling a car. You can start, stop, increase speed, decrease speed, and quit the program. Additionally, it provides a help menu to guide you through the available commands.

## How It Works

The program accepts user input commands to simulate different actions related to a car. You interact with the program by typing commands into the terminal.
